    Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.
    Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.
    Types of Operator:
        Python language supports the following types of operators.
            Arithmetic Operators
            Comparison (Relational) Operators
            Assignment Operators
            Bitwise Operators
            Membership Operators
            Identity Operators
            Operators Precedence
